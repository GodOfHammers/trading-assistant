Based on the provided code files, here are the key points for the FastAPI security component:

1. Key functionalities:
   - Provides security and authentication classes for FastAPI applications.
   - Supports OpenID Connect authentication.
   - Offers various security schemes such as API keys, HTTP authentication (Basic, Bearer, Digest), and OAuth2.

2. Dependencies:
   - Depends on the `starlette` library for request handling and exceptions.
   - Uses `typing_extensions` for additional type annotations.

3. API endpoints/interfaces:
   - The security classes are used as dependencies in FastAPI route definitions to enforce authentication.
   - Example usage: `@app.get("/protected", dependencies=[Depends(OpenIdConnect(openIdConnectUrl="https://example.com/openid"))])`.

4. Important classes and methods:
   - `OpenIdConnect`: Implements OpenID Connect authentication. Requires the OpenID Connect URL and supports optional scheme name, description, and auto error handling.
   - `APIKeyCookie`, `APIKeyHeader`, `APIKeyQuery`: Implement API key authentication using cookies, headers, or query parameters.
   - `HTTPBasic`, `HTTPBearer`, `HTTPDigest`: Implement HTTP authentication schemes.
   - `OAuth2`, `OAuth2AuthorizationCodeBearer`, `OAuth2PasswordBearer`, `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`, `OAuth2PasswordRequestFormStrict`: Implement OAuth2 authentication and authorization.
   - `get_authorization_scheme_param`: Utility function to extract the authorization scheme and parameter from the `Authorization` header.

5. Integration points:
   - The security classes are integrated into FastAPI applications by declaring them as dependencies in route definitions.
   - The `OpenIdConnect` class uses the `Request` class from `starlette` to access the request headers.

The code also includes the `httpcore` library, which provides a low-level HTTP client API. However, it is not directly related to the FastAPI security component.
Key information for the `_api.py` file:

1. Key functionalities:
   - Provides high-level functions for sending HTTP requests using different methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc.).
   - Allows configuring request parameters such as URL, headers, cookies, authentication, proxies, timeouts, and SSL verification.
   - Supports both synchronous and streaming requests.

2. Dependencies:
   - Imports various classes and types from other modules within the `httpx` package, such as `Client`, `Response`, and various request-related types.

3. API endpoints/interfaces:
   - Exposes functions like `request()`, `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `patch()`, `delete()`, etc., which serve as the primary API for making HTTP requests.
   - These functions accept various parameters to configure the request, such as URL, headers, cookies, authentication, proxies, timeouts, and SSL verification.

4. Important classes and methods:
   - The module primarily consists of standalone functions rather than classes.
   - The `request()` function is the core method that sends an HTTP request and returns a `Response` object.
   - The `stream()` function is an alternative to `request()` that streams the response body instead of loading it into memory at once.
   - Other functions like `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, etc., are convenience methods that call `request()` with specific HTTP methods.

5. Integration points:
   - The module integrates with the `Client` class from the `_client` module to create and manage the underlying HTTP client.
   - It uses various types and constants from other modules within the `httpx` package, such as `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_CONFIG` from `_config` and request-related types from `_types`.

This module serves as the high-level API for making HTTP requests using the `httpx` library. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for sending requests with different HTTP methods and configuring various request parameters. The module abstracts away the lower-level details of the HTTP client and provides a convenient way to interact with web services and APIs.
